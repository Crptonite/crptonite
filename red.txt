I learned from Tinker Tanker workshops how to work with different micro:bit libraries and imports, including smart home integrations and the Maqueen Pro robot library. For my Secondary End-of-Year Design & Technology (DNT) project, I applied these skills to design and build a robotic cleaning system. The project involved developing a motorised fan and mopping mechanism attached to a robot to help clean home floors. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in robotics programming, hardware integration, and problem-solving during the design and prototyping process.
